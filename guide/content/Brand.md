# Brand Styleguide

The visual identity of software is an integral part of its user experience.
Correctly using a consistent and attractive style is important to OONI
because it helps users build trust in the work we do.

We hope that this guide will help you create materials and answer
potential questions you might have about the use of the OONI “brand”.

## Logo


### Logo uses

The OONI logo consists of the Octopus icon and wordmark, as shown.

In situations that call for a monochrome logo, the canonical blue and pure
black are acceptable. However, it is preferable to use the standard multi-color
version of the logo when possible. Avoid using the logo in monochrome light
blue or other colors apart the canonical blue.

### Minimum spacing

The logo should be surrounded by blank space at least as wide as the 'I'
character. To measure this vertically, rotate the 'I' by 90 degrees.

### Sub brands

For OONI projects we prefer to use sub-branding rather than have a logo on its
own.

The project name is written in Fira Sans Regular beneath the standard OONI
logo, in the canonical blue.

Depending on the length of the sub-brand, the font size might differ slightly.

### Logo don'ts

We love it when people show the OONI logo, however we kindly ask you to not use
it in the following ways.
