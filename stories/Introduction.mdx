## Introduction

The visual identity of software is an integral part of its user experience.
Correctly using a consistent and attractive style is important to OONI
because it helps users build trust in the work we do.

We hope that this guide will help you create materials and answer
potential questions you might have about the use of the OONI “brand”.
That said, there is a reason we call this a style guide and not a set of style
rules. We expect there to be situations that this guide does not cover, or
where you find yourself needing needing to stretch the standards a bit.
Please reach out to our Creative Lead when you encounter such cases. We
will work with you to help you find a solution for your design problem that
is consistent with the guide. Your feedback will also help us expand and
refine the guide to help it better meet the OONI Community’s needs.


## Contact

For any questions and inquiries you might have related to this styleguide,
we encourage you to reach out to our Creative Lead. We will try to help you
find good answers!

## Conventions

This guide aims to show by doing. The main body of each page contains examples
of graphic elements that are (and, in some cases, are not) conformant with the
style being described. The column on the left specifies the details of each
style and offers guidance on when and how to use it.
