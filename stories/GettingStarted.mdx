# Getting Started

## Developers

The OONI design system is based on selection of carefully tuned [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components.

If you want to start using the components inside of your design all you need to
do is run:

```
npm install --save ooni-components
```

To use the ooni theme you will need to wrap the root of your application with
the `<Provider />` by applying the OONI theme like this:

```jsx
import {
  Provider,
  Heading,
  theme
} from 'ooni-components'

const App = props => (
  <Provider theme={theme}>
    <Heading>Hello world!</Heading>
  </Provider>
)
```
